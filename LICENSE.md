> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

    Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

        1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
        1b. Selling or publishing the unmodified original with no meaningful work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
        1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
        1d. Publishing binaries or competing clones that undermine the ability of the original author to make money from his work. That would be a DICK move.

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a pint.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a bug report.
